subtitle: |
  A novel dataset for Referring Navigable Regions(RNR).
content : |
  The Talk2Car-RegSeg Dataset is built on top of the <a target="_blank" href="https://talk2car.github.io/">Talk2Car dataset</a>, where we augment the existing Talk2car dataset with segmentation masks for  navigable regions corresponding to the driving instructions like <i>"Park behind the blue car"</i>. This dataset is the first of its kind specifically curated for the task of RNR and is best suited to autonomous driving scenarios.
